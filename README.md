# Graduate_Level_Econometrics
This repository contains: Assigned homework assignments and their corresponding Do files as well an empirical paper. This paper measured the effects of adjusted minimum at the county level on employment. Note that assignment 6 and 7 contain Panel data and time series models. All assignments were written using STATA doFiles, however, I am more than comfortable with rewriting these models using R
#Specific Skills Learned:
Panel Data, Time Series Models, ARIMA,  Monte Carlo Simulation, Difference- Difference, etc.
